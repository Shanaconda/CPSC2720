I had a significant amount of issues with CodeBlocks and several IDE 
on my local machine (Used a mac)
I had to do all my implementation on the repo as you probably notice the amount
of commits

********************************
This is project is NOT fully complete
main.cpp DOES NOT use all the function created.
They're 3 memory leaks that I could not find and cause significant
issues with the rest of my Order class.
Otherwise, there is a line coverage of 91% and most of the specification have
been fulfilled.
